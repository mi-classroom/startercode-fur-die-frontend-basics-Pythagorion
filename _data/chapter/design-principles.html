            The challenge is to develop an application that tries 
            to increase the users participation in team sports 
            through online communities. Several factors play 
            into the success of this concept. It is not possible 
            to achieve this goal if the application is not properly 
            designed. To achieve this, design principles of several disciplines are applied to achieve a user-centric 
            solution.

        <p>
            The term “user experience” was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s 
            when he was working at Apple <em>(NORMAN, 2013, P. XIII F.)</em>. User experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its services, and its products. The focus and most important goal of good user experience is to meet the 
            user’s needs in every aspects. Close cooperation is required between different 
            disciplines, such as engineering, marketing, graphic design, industrial design, 
            and interface design <em>(NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.)</em>.

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because 
            good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without 
            drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable."
