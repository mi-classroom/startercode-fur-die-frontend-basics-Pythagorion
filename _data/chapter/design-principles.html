            The challenge is to develop an application that tries 
            to increase the users participation in team sports 
            through online communities. Several factors play 
            into the success of this concept. It is not possible 
            to achieve this goal if the application is not properly 
            designed. To achieve this, design principles of several disciplines are applied to achieve a user-centric 
            solution.

            User Experience Design

        <p>
            The term “user experience” was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s 
            when he was working at Apple <em>(NORMAN, 2013, P. XIII F.)</em>. User experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its services, and its products. The focus and most important goal of good user experience is to meet the 
            user’s needs in every aspects. Close cooperation is required between different 
            disciplines, such as engineering, marketing, graphic design, industrial design, 
            and interface design <em>(NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.)</em>.

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because 
            good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without 
            drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable."
            <br> <em>Norman, 2013, P. XI</em>

            User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given 
            product, from the visuals, the haptics, and the audio to how the product feels. 
            User experience of a product comprises three primary factors: its look, feel, 
            and usability <em>(IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04)</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>Look</h3>
        
        <p>The “look” satisfes the user’s visual expectations of the product. It is about creating a product that is visually appealing and conveys the essence of the product 
            to the user. In addition to pure aesthetics, it is also important that the content is 
            communicated simply and understandably. Therefore, it is not only important 
            how the product looks like but also how information is presented.
        </p>

        <h3>Feel</h3>
        
        <p>The “feel” is about creating products that are not only functional but also fun to 
            use. It is important that it is a pleasant and intuitive experience when interacting with the product on a daily basis.
        </p>

        <h3>Usability</h3>
        
        <p>Usability is the cornerstone of user experience because if a product is diffcult 
            to use, the experience of using it will never be positive. Products should be designed to meet the needs of the user, and the product’s functions should be predictable for the user.
